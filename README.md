# Django Health

## üè• Overview

Django Health is a sophisticated healthcare management system designed to streamline patient care and administrative operations in medical facilities. Built upon the robust Django framework and its powerful REST API capabilities, this platform creates a secure, efficient environment for managing the complex relationships between patients, doctors, and administrative staff.

The system employs a role-based architecture that carefully separates concerns while maintaining cohesive data flow throughout the application. With its PostgreSQL foundation, Django Health ensures data integrity and scalability to support growing healthcare organizations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### User Management & Security

- **Custom User Model**: Uses email as the primary identifier instead of traditional usernames, providing a more intuitive authentication experience while supporting multiple role designations (patient, doctor, admin) through attribute flags.

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implements comprehensive permission systems that ensure users only access information relevant to their role. Doctors can view their patients' records but not others', patients can only access their own information, and administrative staff have configurable access levels to system data.

- **JWT Authentication**: Employs JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication through Simple JWT integration, providing secure, stateless authentication that scales efficiently. Tokens include role information for rapid authorization checks without additional database queries.

### Healthcare Operations

- **Doctor Profiles**: Maintains detailed doctor records including specializations, availability schedules, credentials, and contact information. The system supports filtering doctors by specialty, location, and availability to facilitate patient-doctor matching.

- **Patient Records**: Manages comprehensive patient information including medical history, current medications, appointment records, and insurance details. The system maintains strict access controls while allowing authorized personnel to efficiently retrieve critical patient information.

- **Relationship Mapping**: Creates flexible associations between patients and doctors, supporting primary care relationships, specialist referrals, and temporary associations. The mapping system includes metadata such as relationship type, date established, and referral source.

### System Architecture

- **RESTful API Architecture**: Provides a comprehensive set of endpoints with consistent URL structures, appropriate HTTP verbs, and thoughtful response formatting. The API supports filtering, pagination, and various output formats to accommodate diverse client needs.

- **Admin Dashboard**: Features a customized Django admin interface with intuitive data organization, custom action buttons for common workflows, and integrated filtering and search capabilities. The dashboard includes role-specific views to streamline administrative tasks.

- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Leverages PostgreSQL's advanced features including JSON field storage for flexible metadata, robust transaction support for data integrity, and efficient indexing for query optimization. The database schema is designed for performance while maintaining logical data relationships.

## üìã Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation process, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- Python 3.11 or newer (Python 3.12 recommended for performance improvements)
- PostgreSQL 14+ database server with administrative access
- Virtual environment tool (venv, virtualenv, or conda)
- pip package manager (latest version)
- Git version control system

### Setup Process

#### 1. Clone and Configure Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd django_health

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Database Configuration

Choose one of the following configuration methods based on your security preferences and deployment environment:

**Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended for Production)**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=django_db
DB_USER=django_user
DB_PASSWORD=1234

# Secret Key (Generate using: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))")
SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key

# Debug Mode (set to False in production)
DEBUG=False
```

**Option B: Direct Settings (Development Environment)**

Update the `settings.py` file with your database configuration:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'django_db',
        'USER': 'django_user',
        'PASSWORD': '1234',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'options': '-c search_path=public'
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. PostgreSQL Database Setup

Connect to PostgreSQL as the administrative user and set up the database:

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL as superuser
sudo -u postgres psql

# Execute the following SQL commands
CREATE DATABASE django_db;
CREATE USER django_user WITH PASSWORD '1234';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE django_db TO django_user;
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO django_user;
ALTER USER django_user CREATEDB;  # Needed for running tests
\q
```

#### 4. Application Initialization

Prepare and initialize the application:

```bash
# Generate database migrations for any model changes
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations to set up database structure
python manage.py migrate

# Create an administrative superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser
# Follow the prompts to create your admin account

# Collect static files (for production deployment)
python manage.py collectstatic

# Run the development server
python manage.py runserver
```
